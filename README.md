# About this repository
This repository is consisting of different branches. Each one is an independent Flutter application. The goal is to get to know dart and flutter.
           
# About this branch
This branch is the first thing I implemented with flutter. I was playing with the layout.
I tried to use:
* column
* row
* containers with square and circle shapes.
