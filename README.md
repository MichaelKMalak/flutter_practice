# About this repository
This repository is consisting of different branches. Each one is an independent Flutter application. The goal is to get to know dart and flutter.

# About this branch
I followed instructions presented [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) to implement:
* an endless scrollable list of random names
* stateful buttons that is saved in "_savedWords"
* route to a page of "favourite names"

I added to that:
* List icon is disabled and only works when there is at least one favourite word
* "Share" floating button using "share" plugin
