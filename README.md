# About this repository
This repository is consisting of different branches. Each one of them is an independent Flutter application. I do that to practice/get to know dart and flutter.

# About this branch
This branch is the first thing I implemented with flutter. I was playing with the layout.
I tries to use:
* column
* row
* containers with different shapes
