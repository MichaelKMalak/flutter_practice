# About this repository
This repository is consisting of different branches. Each one is an independent Flutter application. The goal is to get to know dart and flutter.

# About this branch
  * Inspired by [Johny Vinoâ€˜s design](https://dribbble.com/shots/5033686-Your-BMI). The design is of three cards in the homepage, each receive user input with animation.
  * Used [Division package](https://pub.dev/packages/division) as a way to decouple style from structure for a more readable code.
  * Used [async_redux package](https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux) to practice the syntax as the project is very small in scope for this package to be beneficial for it.
